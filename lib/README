This directory should contain all of the library files (or templates)
which MMA uses. The directory 'stdlib' should always be present. It
contains the templates distributed with MMA.

Other, user supplied, template files should be placed in
separate directories. For example, if you create your
own polka library file, you might want to create the
directory 'mymma' and place the file(s) there.

If you do this, make sure that you update the mma library
database with the mma -g command, or force the processing
of your files with the Use directive.

The file MMADIR is a binary database file produced with:

	mma -g
	
don't try to modify it on your own :)
