The files in this directory just illustrate various features
of MMA. Hopefully, the will help in creating some very cool
user donated library files.  They are presented only as
"proof-of-concept" examples.

Unless someone can point to a definitive text showing that
publishing chords for a song is NOT a violation of copyright
we will only distribute mma songs in the main distribution which
are clearly public domain. This really does limit things!

However, a gzip file of many songs is available on the main
MMA website:

	http://mypage.uniserve.com/~bvdp/mma/mma.html
	


The Python program 'mkall' will recurse though all the directories
and attempt to compile any '.mma' files it finds. The resulting
'.mid' file will be created in the same directory as the '.mma'
file.

Have fun!!!!!
