Comment:
 The previous official Debian mma package was debianized by
 Raphael Goulais <rafou@debian.org> on Tue, 13 Jan 2004 13:20:25 +0100.
 .
 Joel Roth <joelz@pobox.com> and Miguel A. Colón Vélez <debian.micove@gmail.com>
 worked on this package in 2011 and 2012 and committed their changes to
 git.debian.org, but unfortunately no release was made.
