 as I do fix them.

The midi data is created, now, in a byte array. Need to check all
 access to the to ensure we're not buggering it with chr() data.

Check all integer divides. In 2 1/2 returns 0; in 3 it is .5. Need to
 change some to //

Check long vrs int types. No Long in 3.


There will be MORE!
