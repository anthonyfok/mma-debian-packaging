Add FF 02 copyright message option

Enhance the html groove docs to <play> a sample for a clicked groove.

It might be easy to add the ability to set different chords for different
   tracks. For example, one might want a C Major chord, but a C7 for
   the arpeggio(s). I'm thinking that we might do "Arpeggio Chord XX"
   and handle it much like a RIFF is done right now. Would there be
   any point/usage?

It might be useful to have a "if file exists" test. Useful for
   conditional includes and things like that. Deciding what path to
   use might be a problem (current path, groove library, include)???


The -b/-B options do NOT work if the section includes any BEATADJUST
   commands.

Add a midi channel volume tracker and setter. This would permit
   midi-(de)cresc from a known (by mma) value.

Library docs --- add the time signature to the header.

Add Nashville chord notation in addition to roman.

There is a bug in the Optimal Voicing code which makes the Centering
   option useless.

To my ear it appears that that when using the -b command line option
   the last bar is truncated. I need to examine the result and the
   code. Might be a one-off problem.
